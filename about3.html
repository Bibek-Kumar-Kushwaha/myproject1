      <p class="b">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see,
        and to
        experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
        I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing
        on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank
        mind,
        I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain
        in summer,
        leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like
        to be
        surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in
        Hangzhou,
        I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and
        movies.
        I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
